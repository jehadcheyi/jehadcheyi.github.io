### 📄 About Me

I am a Computer Engineer with a Master's degree specializing in Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Computer Vision.  
My research focuses on the integration of AI in biomedical and medical imaging, with a strong emphasis on cancer detection—especially breast cancer detection and segmentation.  
I develop and optimize AI-driven pipelines to automatically detect, segment, and classify cancerous lesions, enhancing early diagnosis and supporting clinical decision-making.
